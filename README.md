# IoT-Soil-Moisture-Monitor
IoT (Internet of Things) soil moisture monitor with Raspberry Pi Pico W and Blynk is a project that allows you to monitor the moisture level of your plants remotely through an internet-connected device.

 I used SunFounder Raspberry Pi Pico W Kit to test different Modules. You can buy the kit and perform some other operations as well. From this kit, you can use the following components.
Raspberry Pi Pico Board – 1
Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2.0 – 1
Breadboard – 1
Jumper Wires – 10
Micro-USB Cable – 1

To post the Capacitive Soil Moisture Data to Blynk using Raspberry Pi Pico W, you need to create a Blynk project and set up a dashboard in the mobile or web application.
To visualize the Soil Moisture data on a mobile App or Mobile Dashboard, you also need to set up the Mobile Phone Dashboard.
